          <h3>What I Gained</h3>
          <p>
            In this first semester, I improved my programming skills a lot. I went from being a beginner to a much better coder. Now I understand logic and syntax much better. The course also had many projects and presentations which pushed me to try new things and learn how to work in a team. I also learned how to divide tasks with others and how to explain difficult concepts in simple ways when presenting. Overall, this semester has helped me grow both my software and communication skills.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="details-container">
          <h3>Improvement</h3>
          <p>
            It would be great if there were a small group sessions with lecturers. This would give students a safe space to ask individual questions and get help on difficult topics that students might be too shy to ask during class. For my self-improvement, I want to improve my time management skills. I will create a study schedule and review lecture slides before each class to gain a deeper understanding of the topics being covered.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="details-container">
          <h3>Future Goals</h3>
          <p>
            I want to participate in a Hackathon. I believe my personal growth will accelerate when I am exposed to such intense environment. As I am still building my confidence in programming, a Hackaton will require me to use my skill set to solve practical issues. It will also sharpen my communication skills, as I will need to work together in a team and pitch ideas to the judges.

        <p class="reflection-text"><strong>Reflection:</strong>Attending presentations by Prof. Dr. Masahiro Kitagawa and Mr. Ling Keok Tong showed that quantum technology is an important tool for future digital security and economic resilience. The discussions revealed how ideas like superposition and nitrogen fixation applications will greatly change key industries. A key insight from the summit is that staying competitive requires exploring new fields beyond AI alone.</p>

        <h2 class="experience-sub-title project-title">PPG Talk</h2>
        <p class="reflection-text"><strong>Reflection:</strong> The PPG industry talk was really eye-opening. it showed me that university theory is quite different from the reai challenges of managing data professionally and building systems that can scale up. Because of this, I want to focus on practical technical skills rather than just academic work. I now understand that ICT jobs are vital because they create the foundation for innovation and efficiency in business. To contribute effectively to global companies, / need to focus on mastering key technologies: Python for automation, sQl for reliable data management, and Azure for cloud infrastructure that can expand. These are the high-demand skills i need to develop practical solutions for the industry.</p>

        <h2 class="experience-sub-title project-title">Serunai Talk</h2>
        <p class="reflection-text"><strong>Reflection:</strong> From the talk about Project Management and System Development, I learned how crucial these methods are in making sure our work progress becomes smooth. By implementing these methods on my next project, I can avoid facing any chaos. The speaker also gives a very clear vision on how the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) can lead to successful results by giving daily routines as examples such as cooking. Besides, in the next four years, I plan to apply the knowledge and skills I have gained from this talk to every project I work on. By implementing these methods, I am confident that I can build a successful career in the future.</p>

        <p class="reflection-text"><strong>Reflection:</strong> The UTMDigital Open Day was an eye-opening milestone in my studies. Witnessing the complex infrastructure that powers our campus connectivity bridged the gap between classroom theory and real-world application. It highlighted the immense technical effort required to sustain our daily digital interactions. This experience deepened my appreciation for the unseen systems and expertise that support our modern academic environment and keep us connected.</p>
